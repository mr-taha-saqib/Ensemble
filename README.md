# Ensemble Methods for Sentiment Analysis on Airbnb Dataset

## Lab Task Overview

“Ensemble” is a machine learning technique where multiple models are combined to improve the overall performance of a system. By leveraging the strengths of individual models, ensemble methods create more accurate and robust predictions. The main types of ensemble methods include:

### Types of Ensemble Methods
1. **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):**
   - Trains multiple instances of the same base algorithm on different subsets of the training data (sampled with replacement).
   - Combines predictions to reduce variance and improve accuracy.
   - Example: Random Forest.

2. **Boosting:**
   - Iteratively trains weak learners, giving more weight to misclassified instances in subsequent iterations.
   - Focuses on areas where previous models performed poorly.
   - Examples: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM).

3. **Stacking:**
   - Combines predictions of several base models using a meta-model (e.g., Linear Regression).
   - The meta-model learns the optimal way to aggregate predictions.

4. **Voting:**
   - Uses independent predictions from multiple models.
   - Final predictions are determined by majority voting (classification) or averaging (regression).

## Lab Objectives
The lab focuses on performing **sentiment analysis** on Airbnb reviews using ensemble techniques, such as Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking, to improve classification accuracy.

### Tasks to Perform

#### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- **Steps:**
  - Load the dataset.
  - Preprocess text data by:
    - Removing stopwords and punctuation.
    - Performing tokenization.
  - Convert text data into numerical features using **TF-IDF** or **CountVectorizer**.

#### 2. **Model Training**
- Train individual base models:
  - **Algorithms:** Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- Implement ensemble methods:
  - **Bagging:** Train a Random Forest classifier.
  - **Boosting:** Train an AdaBoost classifier.
  - **Stacking:** Use predictions from base models to train a meta-model.

#### 3. **Model Evaluation**
- Evaluate performance using metrics:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
- Visualize results with:
  - Confusion Matrix.
  - ROC Curve.

#### 4. **Analysis**
- Compare individual model performance with ensemble methods.
- Discuss:
  - Strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
  - Potential improvements to ensemble techniques.

### Case Study: Airbnb Marketing
The goal is to enhance user experience and improve host and renter retention. Key considerations include:
1. **Improving User Experience:**
   - Should Airbnb rank properties based on review sentiment?
   - Compare review sentiment with summary-rating value to predict revenue.

2. **Region-Specific Strategies:**
   - Analyze performance data from **Miami** and **Paris**.
   - Propose:
     - Region-specific pricing strategies.
     - Suggestions for hosts to increase earnings.

---

### Deliverables
1. **Code Implementation:**
   - Perform data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
   - Include plots to back up claims:
     - Statistical results.
     - Confusion matrices and ROC curves.

2. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Discuss findings and support with metrics and visualizations.

---

### Example Insights
- **User Experience:** Review sentiment might offer granular insights compared to summary ratings, helping Airbnb recommend top-performing properties.
- **Region-Specific Strategy:** Regional trends in property performance could guide pricing or suggest improvements for hosts.
